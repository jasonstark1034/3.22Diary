# 3.22Diary
  Well,it's been such a long time not writting a monthly diary.And this time, i'll divide this essay into 2 parts, one talks 
about what i've done in this March, the other talks about what i want to do lately.
 
 In March, the start of the new term. Firstly, i learned the Multiple points and Multivariate function integral, which is 
truly useful to the advanced study and mathamatical modelizing. Then, i took the physics lessons, it's not that difficult or 
hard to understand, but it include the integral studies to the knowledge, makes the problem more diversified and easy to solve.
Another significant lessons is the C language programming, since now we just learne the most basic programming skills, such as 
printf,scanf,main function,call function,the basic structure like sequence select and cyclic structure,some other escape chars.
These things aren't that hard for me, and i realize that i ought to learn algorithm well to improve my programming capacity.
Lastly, it's about the English study, since i should pass the cet 6 in an ideal marks,i've insisted review the vocabulary in the
past few month, maybe recognized nearly 1000 words.
 
 Here, i'll write down what i am supposed to achieve in the followingh days. First and foremost, insisting checking out the 
math notebook and realize the mathamatical theories toatally.Then, try to learn the pysics and C language classas careafully 
and don't let those incidences slip away, in the meanwhile, insist touching the new english words and creating more pure English
enviroment. Last but not least, pay more time to the mathamatic modelizing, get to read more data about matlab,modelizing 
articles, and loads of models examples, try to work with my teamate in a harmony. As for the Electronic design competition, 
i'll also achieve the task my teamleader set down. But most of my energy will be paid on MM cause i'm more interested in it.
 
 Time is so valueble the now i'll make the end right here.
